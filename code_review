The code is overall readable and very organized. I would have found it helpful for the methods and the queries within them to be commented throughout. That way the purpose of each part of the code could be understood at a glance. 
In a functional capacity everything looked like it would work the way it is intended to.
One difference I noticed your query field text method and query field numeric methods were generalized and had the capacity to return a large variety of data where as I used alot more methods that were more specific to what was being looked for. I like that you methods were multipurpose in that capacity.
